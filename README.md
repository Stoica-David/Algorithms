# Algorithms

This is some of my work I did for my algorithms course in the first semester of my first year of university. Below you can find a brief explanation of each cpp.

3Vectors.cpp - given a number of p non-zero values and three vectors: Va, La, Ca that contain the values, line index and column index of the non-zero values, build the corresponding matrix, then sum the matrix with another matrix B, that is also stored in three similar vectors;

BinarySearch.cpp - given two vectors, use binary search to determine which elements from the second vector are in the first vector;

BucketSort.cpp - classic BucketSort algorithm;

CloseToZero.cpp -given a vector of integers, find the two elements of which sum is the closest to zero in the vector;

EfficientInsertionSort.cpp - modify the insertion sort algorithm by using binary search to find the position where an element should be inserted;

GuestList.cpp - given a list of guests, a list that shows which guests know each other  and knowing that John wants to call n people at his party provided that each person that comes knows at least 5 people that are at the party and doesn't know at least 5 people from there, help John organize the party by printing the people that John can call, use a greedy algorithm; 

HorseProblem.cpp - given a chess board with n lines and m columns, and a starting position for a horse, determine whether the horse can traverse the whole table without traversing the same tile more than once. Use a greedy algorithm;

InsertEfficiently.cpp - check if a given vector is sorted (decreasing order), then insert the given numbers into the vector as efficient as possible;

KnapsackProblem.cpp - classic knapsack problem solved with a Greedy algorithm;

Library.cpp - there is a library that contains a number of shelves, each shelf contains a certain number of books (the same number for all the shelves). For each book we know the title and the year of publication. Write a Divide & Conquer algorithm to print how many shelves have their books sorted by title, respectively by year of publication;

MergeVectors.cpp - given two vectors, merge them into one vector (that is sorted);

MissingNumber.cpp - given n-1 unsigned integers in the [0, n-1] range, write a Divide & Conquer algorithm to determine wich number from 0 to n-1 is missing;

Multiply1to9.cpp - given a number, store it into a vector, generate a random number bewteen 1 and 9, then multiplicate the initial number with the random number without using "*" or repeated "+";

NthFibonacci.cpp - print the n-th fibonacci number using a Divide & Conquer algorithm;

PolynomialMultiplication.cpp - given two polynomials, print the product of them using a Divide & Conquer algorithm;

SortCalendar.cpp - given a number of calendar dates, for each date check if its format is valid and sort the valid dates;

SortPalindroms.cpp - given a vector, sort the palindroms in that vector;

SpiralTraversal.cpp - given a matrix, print its elements in spiral order;

Trees.cpp - given an orchard that contains on each row and column a tree with its own number of fruits, print the sum of fruits for the trees that contain a number of fruits that is prime.
